STEP 3: Update Documentation
============================================================

Copy and paste this entire prompt into Claude Opus 4:
------------------------------------------------------------

The code has been successfully pushed to https://github.com/gautamrk25/business-analytics-platform.git

Now I need to update all documentation files that reference the old repository URL.

Please:
1. Search for all markdown files in the current directory and subdirectories
2. In each markdown file, replace:
   - Old URL: https://github.com/gautamrk25/2025.git
   - New URL: https://github.com/gautamrk25/business-analytics-platform.git
3. Also update any path references:
   - Old: "cd 2025/Onix/Customers/Retail/2025/business-analysis-platform"
   - New: "cd business-analytics-platform"
4. Show me which files were updated and what changes were made
5. After updating all files, create a git commit with the message: "Update repository URLs after migration"
6. Push the commit to the new repository

Please show me each file that gets updated and confirm the changes.
