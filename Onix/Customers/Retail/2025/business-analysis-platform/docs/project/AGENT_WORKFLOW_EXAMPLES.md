# AI Agent Workflow Examples

## Example 1: Retail Sales Analysis

### Scenario
A retail business analyst uploads 3 months of sales data and asks: "What's driving the decline in our electronics category?"

### Agent Collaboration Flow

   ├─ Receives request
   ├─ Initiates workflow
   └─ Coordinates agents

3. INDUSTRY DETECTIVE (0.5 seconds)
   ├─ Analyzes columns: product_category, store_id, sales_amount, date
   ├─ Detects: RETAIL (confidence: 92%)
   └─ Returns: Industry context and relevant KPIs

4. EXECUTION MANAGER
   ├─ Creates job ID: analysis_12345
   ├─ Initiates WebSocket connection
   └─ Starts progress tracking

5. BUSINESS ANALYSIS AGENT (3-5 seconds)
   ├─ Applies retail-specific analysis:
   │  ├─ Seasonal decomposition
   │  ├─ Store performance comparison
   │  ├─ Product mix analysis
   │  └─ Price elasticity check
   ├─ Identifies issues:
   │  ├─ 30% drop in TV sales
   │  ├─ 25% drop in laptop sales
   │  └─ Phones stable
   └─ Discovers patterns:
      ├─ Drops coincide with competitor sale
      └─ Premium models most affected

6. CODE INSPECTOR (if needed)
   ├─ Error: "Column 'product_cat' not found"
   ├─ Suggestion: "Use 'product_category' instead"
   └─ Auto-correction applied

7. MEMORY KEEPER
   ├─ Stores analysis pattern
   ├─ Records: "Electronics analysis → check competitor activity"
   └─ Updates industry knowledge base

8. RESULTS GENERATION
   ├─ Dashboard: Visual trends by product
   ├─ Insights: 
   │  ├─ "Premium electronics down 35% due to competitor pricing"
   │  ├─ "Budget items maintaining market share"
   │  └─ "Online channel most impacted"
   └─ Recommendations:
      ├─ "Launch price-match guarantee"
      ├─ "Focus promotion on premium items"
      └─ "Increase online marketing spend"

Total Time: ~8 seconds
```

## Example 2: SaaS Churn Analysis

### Scenario
A SaaS business analyst asks: "Why did our enterprise customers churn last quarter?"

### Agent Collaboration Flow

```
1. USER INPUT
   ├─ Data: customer_data.csv, usage_metrics.csv
   └─ Question: "Why did our enterprise customers churn last quarter?"

2. ORCHESTRATOR AGENT
   ├─ Validates data compatibility
   └─ Initiates multi-source analysis

3. INDUSTRY DETECTIVE (0.5 seconds)
   ├─ Analyzes: subscription_tier, MRR, feature_usage
   ├─ Detects: SAAS (confidence: 98%)
   └─ Activates: SaaS-specific metrics

4. BUSINESS ANALYSIS AGENT (5-7 seconds)
   ├─ SaaS-specific analysis:
   │  ├─ Cohort analysis
   │  ├─ Feature adoption rates
   │  ├─ Support ticket correlation
   │  └─ Usage pattern changes
   ├─ Findings:
   │  ├─ 80% of churned had <30% feature adoption
   │  ├─ Support tickets increased 3x before churn
   │  └─ API usage dropped 50% in final month
   └─ Root causes:
      ├─ Poor onboarding (20% didn't complete)
      ├─ Missing key integration (requested 5x)
      └─ Performance issues with large datasets

5. MEMORY KEEPER
   ├─ Recognizes pattern: "Similar to Q2 2023 churn"
   ├─ Retrieves: Previous successful interventions
   └─ Suggests: Historical solutions that worked

6. RESULTS
   ├─ Churn prediction model
   ├─ Risk score for current customers
   ├─ Actionable interventions
   └─ Expected impact quantified

Total Time: ~12 seconds
```

## Example 3: Error Recovery Scenario

### Scenario
Analyst uploads corrupted data file with formatting issues.

### Error Handling Flow

```
1. INITIAL ERROR
   ├─ File: messy_sales_data.xlsx
   ├─ Error: "Date format inconsistent"
   └─ Orchestrator → Code Inspector

2. CODE INSPECTOR ANALYSIS
   ├─ Identifies: Mixed date formats (MM/DD/YYYY and DD-MM-YY)
   ├─ Suggests: Standardization approach
   └─ Auto-fix: Converts all to ISO format

3. SECOND ERROR
   ├─ Error: "Negative values in quantity column"
   ├─ Inspector: "Likely returns, create separate column"
   └─ Auto-fix: Split into sales and returns

4. VALIDATION PASS
   ├─ Data cleaned successfully
   ├─ Analysis proceeds normally
   └─ User notified of automatic fixes

5. MEMORY UPDATE
   ├─ Pattern stored: "Company X uses mixed date formats"
   ├─ Future files: Auto-apply same fixes
   └─ No user intervention needed

Total Recovery Time: +3 seconds
```
