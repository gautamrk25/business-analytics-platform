STEP 4: Verify Migration
============================================================

Copy and paste this entire prompt into Claude Opus 4:
------------------------------------------------------------

The repository migration should now be complete. Please help me verify everything worked correctly.

Please perform these verification steps:

1. Check the current git remote configuration:
   - Run: git remote -v
   - Confirm it shows: https://github.com/gautamrk25/business-analytics-platform.git

2. Test pushing to the new repository:
   - Run: git push origin main
   - Confirm it succeeds (or says "Everything up-to-date")

3. Verify the repository by cloning it to a temporary directory:
   - Create a temp directory
   - Clone: git clone https://github.com/gautamrk25/business-analytics-platform.git temp_verify
   - List the files in temp_verify
   - Check for key files: README.md, main.py, requirements.txt, COLLABORATOR_GUIDE.md
   - Count total files
   - Remove the temp directory

4. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with a migration note:
   - Add an entry under "Daily Progress Tracking" with today's date
   - Note: "Successfully migrated repository from https://github.com/gautamrk25/2025.git to https://github.com/gautamrk25/business-analytics-platform.git"
   - Commit with message: "Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with repository migration note"
   - Push to the new repository

5. Provide a final summary confirming:
   - All files are present in the new repository
   - Documentation has been updated
   - Git history is preserved
   - The new repository URL for sharing: https://github.com/gautamrk25/business-analytics-platform.git
